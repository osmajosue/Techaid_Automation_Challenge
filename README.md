# Techaid_Automation_Challenge
This is my solution to automate and validate various twitter functionalities. This is done using Selenium Webdriver, Java, Junit, and Maven.

## REQUIREMENTS
### Before running this test framework, you will need:
* The Chrome web browser version 86.0 or higher is required to run the tests.
* Java version 15.0.1 installed ([Download](https://www.java.com/en/download/))
* Maven version 3.6.3 installed ([Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)), ([Installation](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), [Configure](https://maven.apache.org/configure.html))
* Maven compiler needs to be 1.6 or higher (1.8 on the project)
* Maven and Java environment setup ([Setup](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_environment_setup.htm))
* IntelliJ IDE (optional) ([Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))


## USAGE

In order to run these tests from the terminal you will need to be on the project path and use the following command:
```shell
mvn test
```

## RUNTIME EXPLANATION

Here is a briefly explanation on how the code works, the outstanding classes and, their purpose on the project.

### PageObjects Classes
In the project are two main page object classes:
* SignUpPage: This class contains the web elements and some of the behaviour of the signup page of the web application being tested (https://twitter.com)
* HomePage: This class contains the web elements and the behaviour of the home page or account page of the web application being tested (https://twitter.com)

For the sake of this project, because of its simplicity, I decided not to abstract more using a locators class containing the elements. However, using a class for this purpose is the recommended way to do it in a Page Object Model designed project.

### Utils Classes
In the project are two Utils classes, aimed at helping with data storage and scripting functionalities that are out of the main page objects.
* Helpers: This class contains data variables that are useful on every stage of the tests. This data variables are static, but can be dynamically changed if needed.
* Utilities: This class contains two methods for getting a Fake email account and a verification code. This serves the purpose of one of the stages of the test.


### TestPlan Class
In this main test class, all the tests are performed. Assertions are made in some instances of this class.
This class contains Test methods for the 5 test scenarios requested.
Test scenarios requested:
* Create a new twitter account, and validate.
* Tweet a plain text and validate.
* Tweet text and an image attached, and validate that an image was tweeted.
* Tweet text and a video attached, and validate that a video was tweeted. Also, interact with the video (play, pause, mute and unmute)
* Tweet text and a link attached, and validate that the link was tweeted.

Bonus Test Case:
* Validate the video interactions.

### Media Interaction
There is a Test method that uploads a video and interacts with it.

### Time Considerations
Inside all the methods called by the test methods, there is waiting time period to emulate how a real user would interact with the application.


### Other Considerations
Since twitter has an anti-bot mechanism, after successfully creating 3-4 accounts, you will need to restart your router in order to have a new IP.
